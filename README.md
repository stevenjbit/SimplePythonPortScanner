<h1> Simple Python Port Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I wanted to create a simple port scanner with Python to grow my understanding of python, networking and cybersecurity. Although NMAP is the gold standard for port scanning, it is still entirely feasible and enlightening to use python for this purpose. Future edits will include threading to speed up the port scanner. 

<h2>Languages and utilities used:</h2>

- Python
- PyCharm Community Edition 2022.3.3

As can be seen, this port scanner is rather slow (although port scanning is generally a slow process). A future edit will institute threading to speed it up somewhat. It would also be a good idea to edit the code to narrow the range of ports to be scanned.
